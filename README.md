# Puzzle-Game


A little bit more complex project for a classic puzzle where an image is divided in many pieces and to solve it you have to arrange the pieces accordingly. 

The script was written in ECMAScript 6 and I used selectors, functions, let and const, methods and events.

No frameworks used.
